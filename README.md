# Currently ITS INTENDED TO BE USEFUL TO MYSELF DON'T USE THIS

# Simply put cursor with search.

Yet another cursor movement helper, simple but effective at least for me ;).  
This plugin simply indended to put the cursor by seach on screen.  
In other word, targeting only visible area, no scroll to upward/downword.  
If I want search from all area of buffer, I chose `/`, `?`.  

If you don't like this plugin?  
It's ok, there are a lot of plugins like bellow.  

* [easy_motion](https://github.com/Lokaltog/vim-easymotion)
* [clever-f](https://github.com/rhysd/clever-f.vim)
* [sneak](https://github.com/justinmk/vim-sneak)

# TODO
Now just experimental phase.
A lot of TODO to improve!

- move between candidate with keybind
- skip fold from search

# Configuration example

    " map normal-mode 's' for simple search
    nmap s <Plug>(smalls-all)


    " or 
    nmap s <Plug>(smalls-forward)
    nmap S <Plug>(smalls-backward)
